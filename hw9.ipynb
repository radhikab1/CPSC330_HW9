    "1. The problem with labeling customers as “churned” or “not churned” is that this ignores time-to-event and fails to handle right-censoring. Many customers have not yet churned at the time we observe them, so their true churn time is censored, not “non-churn.” Treating these censored observations as if the event will never occur introduces bias, and removing them leaves you with only customers whose churn events have already happened (those with shorter observed event times). This distorts the distribution of churn times and leads standard supervised learning models to produce incorrect or misleading predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We cannot determine who is more likely to churn first, because survival analysis requires more than just the current observed time. The hazard of churn can increase, decrease, or stay constant over time depending on the service, and we have no information about the underlying hazard function or customer covariates. Therefore, based solely on “one week vs. one year,” we do not have enough information to compare their time-to-event distributions or their hazards of churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the survival function is nearly flat during some time interval, it means that the probability of surviving beyond that time, i.e., not churning barely changes. In other words, very few churn events occur in that period, and the hazard of churn is low. Customers who reach that interval tend to continue remaining with the service, indicating a stable retention phase."

    "Write up your analysis from hw5 or any other assignment or your side project on machine learning in a \"blog post\" or report format. It's fine if you just write it here in this notebook. Alternatively, you can publish your blog post publicly and include a link here. (See exercise 4.3.) The target audience for your blog post is someone like yourself right before you took this course. They don't necessarily have ML knowledge, but they have a solid foundation in technical matters. The post should focus on explaining **your results and what you did** in a way that's understandable to such a person, **not** a lesson trying to teach someone about machine learning. Again: focus on the results and why they are interesting; avoid pedagogical content.\n",

    "- Description of the model.\n",

    "- A section on caveats, describing at least 3 reasons why your results might be incorrect, misleading, overconfident, or otherwise problematic. Make reference to your specific dataset, model, approach, etc. To check that your reasons are specific enough, make sure they would not make sense, if left unchanged, to most students' submissions; for example, do not just say \"overfitting\" without explaining why you might be worried about overfitting in your specific case.\n",
    "- At least 3 visualizations. These visualizations must be embedded/interwoven into the text, not pasted at the end. The text must refer directly to each visualization. For example \"as shown below\" or \"the figure demonstrates\" or \"take a look at Figure 1\", etc. It is **not** sufficient to put a visualization in without referring to it directly.\n",

    "As I look back on this course, there were a few moments that really changed how I think about machine learning. One major “aha” moment was when I finally understood how important proper data splitting is. Before this course, I thought of train/validation/test splits as a routine step, but I didn’t realize how easy it is to accidentally leak information. Seeing how preprocessing the whole dataset before splitting or ignoring time order can completely ruin a model’s evaluation made me rethink a lot of my past work. If I revisited those projects now, I would definitely use proper pipelines and time-aware splits to make the results actually trustworthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another concept that was important for me was regularization and the bias–variance tradeoff. It made me understand why high training accuracy isn't always preferrable. The examples in class showed how a model can look good on the surface while performing poorly in reality. It made me realize the value of slightly simpler, well-regularized models. Going forward, I’ll pay a lot more attention to validation curves and generalization rather than just chasing the highest accuracy number.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third big moment came from learning about feature engineering and interpretability. I used to assume the model choice mattered more than the features, but the course made me see how much a thoughtful feature or a domain-specific transformation can improve performance. This is something I’ll carry into future projects—spending more time understanding the data instead of jumping straight into complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, survival analysis was completely new to me, and it changed how I think about problems like churn prediction. Learning about time-to-event modeling, hazard, and right-censoring made me realize how much more accurate and realistic survival methods are for this kind of problem, especially in past work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this course shifted my mindset. I now pay much more attention to data quality, evaluation, and assumptions instead of focusing only on algorithms. These lessons will definitely shape how I design future projects, taking use of better practices."
