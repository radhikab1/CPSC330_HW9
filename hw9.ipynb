    "1. The problem with labeling customers as “churned” or “not churned” is that this ignores time-to-event and fails to handle right-censoring. Many customers have not yet churned at the time we observe them, so their true churn time is censored, not “non-churn.” Treating these censored observations as if the event will never occur introduces bias, and removing them leaves you with only customers whose churn events have already happened (those with shorter observed event times). This distorts the distribution of churn times and leads standard supervised learning models to produce incorrect or misleading predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We cannot determine who is more likely to churn first, because survival analysis requires more than just the current observed time. The hazard of churn can increase, decrease, or stay constant over time depending on the service, and we have no information about the underlying hazard function or customer covariates. Therefore, based solely on “one week vs. one year,” we do not have enough information to compare their time-to-event distributions or their hazards of churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the survival function is nearly flat during some time interval, it means that the probability of surviving beyond that time, i.e., not churning barely changes. In other words, very few churn events occur in that period, and the hazard of churn is low. Customers who reach that interval tend to continue remaining with the service, indicating a stable retention phase."

    "Write up your analysis from hw5 or any other assignment or your side project on machine learning in a \"blog post\" or report format. It's fine if you just write it here in this notebook. Alternatively, you can publish your blog post publicly and include a link here. (See exercise 4.3.) The target audience for your blog post is someone like yourself right before you took this course. They don't necessarily have ML knowledge, but they have a solid foundation in technical matters. The post should focus on explaining **your results and what you did** in a way that's understandable to such a person, **not** a lesson trying to teach someone about machine learning. Again: focus on the results and why they are interesting; avoid pedagogical content.\n",

    "# Predicting Credit Card Default Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models can be very helpful in banking. They are good at recognizing patterns that a human might not, and they can perform certain tasks much faster than humans. Machine learning can improve efficacy and security in the banking field at low cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task was to train a model to predict whether a client will default on their credit card payment. This is a **classificatio**n problem–we are trying to predict which of the two **classes** (positive or negative) an example belongs to. To do this, we tried different models, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, then selected the best performing model at the end. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our process can be broken down into five steps:\n",
    "1. Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "2. Feature Engineering and Preprocessing\n",
    "3. Modeling and Evaluation\n",
    "4. Interpretation\n",
    "5. Caveats and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrangling and EDA\n",
    "Our goal is to use training data to “teach” a model the patterns associated with defaults. In order to use the data effectively and appropriately, we need to understand it very well. Fortunately, the data was already clean and tidy, meaning that we didn’t have to clean it ourselves. Our training data consists of 30,000 rows and 25 columns. Each row represents one customer and includes: \n",
    "\n",
    "Our **target** variable, the “class” of the observation:\n",
    "- default.payment.next.month\n",
    "And **features**, the explanatory variables:\n",
    "- Customer Id: 'ID'\n",
    "- Credit Limit: 'LIMIT_BAL'\n",
    "- Demographics:'SEX', 'EDUCATION','MARRIAGE','AGE'\n",
    "- Recent repayment statuses: 'PAY_0','PAY_2',...,'PAY_6'\n",
    "- Recent bill amounts: 'BILL_AMT1','BILL_AMT2',...,'BILL_AMT6'\n",
    "- Recent payment amounts: 'PAY_AMT1', 'PAY_AMT2',...,'PAY_AMT6'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We took a quick look at the data by conducting some exploratory data analysis (EDA). We looked at summary statistics, data types, and some distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can look at the distributions of certain features: \n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"../../images/balance_limit_dist\" width=\"500\"/>\n",

    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"../../images/previous_amt_dist\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",

    "We can even see the distribution according to class:\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"../../images/age_by_class\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "Notably, for classification problems, we want to know if there is **class imbalance**–when one class is much more common than the other. If that is the case, we would need to take extra precautions when training our model. Thankfully, this chart shows us that while there is some imbalance, the issue is not severe.\n",

    "This helped us select ROC AUC score as our evaluation metric. Different scoring metrics have different uses. Given that we wanted to compare different models against each other, we chose ROC AUC because it provides a good summary of performance over all possible thresholds, and can address class imbalances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "We created some new features, in the hopes that they would either bring new insights or reduce computational burden. We averaged the different bill and payment amounts, then used those features to create an average ratio between the two. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then preprocessed the data, applying transformations so that the model is able to process them as inputs, they and that the real-world meaning of the data is preserved. \n",
    "\n",
    "We applied scaling to the numerical features to make sure that each feature has the same scale, thereby ensuring equal consideration for all features. We applied One Hot Encoding to the categorical features (sex, education, marriage). This is because we want to preserve their distinct meanings using a numerical format. \n",

While we have some decent results, it’s very possible that there are better-performing hyperparameter values. This might mean that we are not using the best hyperparameters, or even the best model. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Demographic Biases\n",
    "There was demographic information included in the features–sex, marriage, and education. Including these features might cause biases to show up in our model, which is particularly harmful for a context such as banking. If certain groups are systemically economically disadvantaged, that might show up in the data. If the model were actually used, it might display these biases. For example, the model might learn that young people with low education are at risk for default, and then penalize all young people with low education, even if they would not have defaulted. \n",

    "As I look back on this course, there were a few moments that really changed how I think about machine learning. One major “aha” moment was when I finally understood how important proper data splitting is. Before this course, I thought of train/validation/test splits as a routine step, but I didn’t realize how easy it is to accidentally leak information. Seeing how preprocessing the whole dataset before splitting or ignoring time order can completely ruin a model’s evaluation made me rethink a lot of my past work. If I revisited those projects now, I would definitely use proper pipelines and time-aware splits to make the results actually trustworthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another concept that was important for me was regularization and the bias–variance tradeoff. It made me understand why high training accuracy isn't always preferrable. The examples in class showed how a model can look good on the surface while performing poorly in reality. It made me realize the value of slightly simpler, well-regularized models. Going forward, I’ll pay a lot more attention to validation curves and generalization rather than just chasing the highest accuracy number.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third big moment came from learning about feature engineering and interpretability. I used to assume the model choice mattered more than the features, but the course made me see how much a thoughtful feature or a domain-specific transformation can improve performance. This is something I’ll carry into future projects—spending more time understanding the data instead of jumping straight into complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, survival analysis was completely new to me, and it changed how I think about problems like churn prediction. Learning about time-to-event modeling, hazard, and right-censoring made me realize how much more accurate and realistic survival methods are for this kind of problem, especially in past work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this course shifted my mindset. I now pay much more attention to data quality, evaluation, and assumptions instead of focusing only on algorithms. These lessons will definitely shape how I design future projects, taking use of better practices."
