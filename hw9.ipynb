    "1. The problem with labeling customers as “churned” or “not churned” is that this ignores time-to-event and fails to handle right-censoring. Many customers have not yet churned at the time we observe them, so their true churn time is censored, not “non-churn.” Treating these censored observations as if the event will never occur introduces bias, and removing them leaves you with only customers whose churn events have already happened (those with shorter observed event times). This distorts the distribution of churn times and leads standard supervised learning models to produce incorrect or misleading predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We cannot determine who is more likely to churn first, because survival analysis requires more than just the current observed time. The hazard of churn can increase, decrease, or stay constant over time depending on the service, and we have no information about the underlying hazard function or customer covariates. Therefore, based solely on “one week vs. one year,” we do not have enough information to compare their time-to-event distributions or their hazards of churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the survival function is nearly flat during some time interval, it means that the probability of surviving beyond that time, i.e., not churning barely changes. In other words, very few churn events occur in that period, and the hazard of churn is low. Customers who reach that interval tend to continue remaining with the service, indicating a stable retention phase."

    "Write up your analysis from hw5 or any other assignment or your side project on machine learning in a \"blog post\" or report format. It's fine if you just write it here in this notebook. Alternatively, you can publish your blog post publicly and include a link here. (See exercise 4.3.) The target audience for your blog post is someone like yourself right before you took this course. They don't necessarily have ML knowledge, but they have a solid foundation in technical matters. The post should focus on explaining **your results and what you did** in a way that's understandable to such a person, **not** a lesson trying to teach someone about machine learning. Again: focus on the results and why they are interesting; avoid pedagogical content.\n",

    "- Description of the model.\n",

    "- A section on caveats, describing at least 3 reasons why your results might be incorrect, misleading, overconfident, or otherwise problematic. Make reference to your specific dataset, model, approach, etc. To check that your reasons are specific enough, make sure they would not make sense, if left unchanged, to most students' submissions; for example, do not just say \"overfitting\" without explaining why you might be worried about overfitting in your specific case.\n",
    "- At least 3 visualizations. These visualizations must be embedded/interwoven into the text, not pasted at the end. The text must refer directly to each visualization.

    "# Predicting Credit Card Default Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning can improve banking at a low cost. ML models can quickly find patterns and make predictions, resulting in increased efficacy for banks and better security for clients. Our project was to predict whether a client will default on their credit card payment. This is a binary **classification** problem–discerning between defaulting or not. We tried different models, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, then selected the best-performing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrangling and EDA\n",
    "In order to use the data effectively and appropriately, we need to understand it well. Fortunately, the training data was already clean and tidy. It consists of 30,000 rows and 25 columns. Each row represents one client and includes: \n",
    "\n",
    "Our **target** variable, the **class**:\n",
    "- default.payment.next.month\n",
    "And **features**, the explanatory variables:\n",
    "- Customer Id: 'ID'\n",
    "- Credit Limit: 'LIMIT_BAL'\n",
    "- Demographics:'SEX', 'EDUCATION','MARRIAGE','AGE'\n",
    "- Recent repayment statuses: 'PAY_0','PAY_2',...,'PAY_6'\n",

    "- Recent payment amounts: 'PAY_AMT1', 'PAY_AMT2',...,'PAY_AMT6'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We conducted EDA to examine the data. We looked at summary statistics, data types, and some distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we looked at the distributions of features: \n",

    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/age_by_class.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "We want to know if there is **class imbalance**, to know if we would need to take extra precautions. Thankfully, this chart shows us the imbalance is not severe. In this context, a false negative would be more harmful than a false positive, but we still want to avoid false positives.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This helped us select **ROC-AUC** score as our evaluation metric. Given that we wanted to compare different models against each other, ROC-AUC was the most suitable metric, because it provides a good summary of performance over all thresholds, while handling class imbalances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hoping that they would either bring new insights or reduce computational burden, we engineered new features: \n",

    "- average_payment_amt (average of 6 payment amounts)\n",
    "- avg_bill_to_pay_ratio (ratio between the two previous features)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We then preprocessed the data, applying transformations so each model receives consistent inputs.\n",

    "### Caveats and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limited Tuning\n",
    "Because this was a school project done with time and resource constraints, we were not able to run a very robust search for hyperparameters. While our best-performing model has decent results, there might be better-performing hyperparameter values. We might not be using the best hyperparameters, or even the best type of model. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Demographic Biases\n",
    "The features include demographic information–sex, marriage, and education. This might cause biases to show up in our model, which is particularly harmful for a context such as banking. For example, the model might learn that young people are at risk for default, and then penalize people just for being young. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uniform Data\n",
    "The data comes from Taiwanese clients between April and September 2005. There might have been changes in patterns in the past 20 years, and the behaviour of Taiwanese clients might not generalize to other regions. This means that our model might perform poorly in other temporal and regional contexts.\n"

    "As I look back on this course, there were a few moments that really changed how I think about machine learning. One major “aha” moment was when I finally understood how important proper data splitting is. Before this course, I thought of train/validation/test splits as a routine step, but I didn’t realize how easy it is to accidentally leak information. Seeing how preprocessing the whole dataset before splitting or ignoring time order can completely ruin a model’s evaluation made me rethink a lot of my past work. If I revisited those projects now, I would definitely use proper pipelines and time-aware splits to make the results actually trustworthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another concept that was important for me was regularization and the bias–variance tradeoff. It made me understand why high training accuracy isn't always preferrable. The examples in class showed how a model can look good on the surface while performing poorly in reality. It made me realize the value of slightly simpler, well-regularized models. Going forward, I’ll pay a lot more attention to validation curves and generalization rather than just chasing the highest accuracy number.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third big moment came from learning about feature engineering and interpretability. I used to assume the model choice mattered more than the features, but the course made me see how much a thoughtful feature or a domain-specific transformation can improve performance. This is something I’ll carry into future projects—spending more time understanding the data instead of jumping straight into complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, survival analysis was completely new to me, and it changed how I think about problems like churn prediction. Learning about time-to-event modeling, hazard, and right-censoring made me realize how much more accurate and realistic survival methods are for this kind of problem, especially in past work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this course shifted my mindset. I now pay much more attention to data quality, evaluation, and assumptions instead of focusing only on algorithms. These lessons will definitely shape how I design future projects, taking use of better practices."
